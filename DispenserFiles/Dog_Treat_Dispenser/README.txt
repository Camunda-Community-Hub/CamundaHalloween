# Summary

This is a dog treat dispenser based on the Judd Treat Dispenser code from NYCCNC.  Project information available here: http://www.nyccnc.com/judd-treat-machine.html

I modified the code so it controls a servo to dispense the treats.  It's not complete yet, still modifying the code.  But all the parts have been designed or remixed from other models.

The webcam stand is a remix of this project:

The servo stand is an unpublished remix from this project:

Infill: Varied, thin walled items like the tubes and spout were 25% other things were about 15%

Notes: 
I think only the spout required support. the spiral was printed standing up.
the feeder tube was printed standing up, the hopper on top was printed standing up.
